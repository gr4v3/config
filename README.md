config webservice



  With this system you can provide remotely those configuration files required by frameworks.

  Don't waste your time in searching the config files every time you need to change some simple values. It's all fetched through a web address or can even be fetched by remote connection like 'telnet' connections. You can manage all the config files from multiple frameworks at the same time. It's all resident on a common backend profile hosted in a singular server. 

  This system also supports login security and counter-measurements for connection failures.
